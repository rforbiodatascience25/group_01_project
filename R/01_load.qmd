# Load data

### Make \_raw dir

```{r}
#| warning: false
# Create data dirs using base R
dir.create("../_raw/")
dir.create("../data/")
```

### Loading GEO data using GEOquery

<https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/moac/people/students/peter_cock/r/geo/>

On the GEO database, files are stored as .soft files, with metadata in the beginning and (for the case of "GSE11223") gene expression data at the end.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
install.packages("GEOquery")
library(GEOquery)
library(tidyverse)
```

The getGEO function from GEOquery obtains queries GEO datasets with the GEO id (if specified). In this case for GSE11223. Else, filename can be supplied to import a downloaded file from the GEO database

```{r}
#| message: false
gse11223 <- getGEO(GEO="GSE11223")
gds3268 <- getGEO(GEO="GDS3268")
```

#### Working with the raw "gse" data

For GSE11223, getGEO pulls the data into a list of length 1. The file GSE11223_series_matrix.txt.gz is extracted into the first (and only) position of that list. We therefore extract the data, getting rid of the parent list:

```{r}
gse11223 <- gse11223$GSE11223_series_matrix.txt.gz
```

Now, the gse11223 variable is a "Large ExpressionSet" of 44.1MB.

#### Working with the curated "gds" data

gds3268 is the curated dataset for the project, meaning that the meta data of samples and the expression table can be easily extracted using Meta() and Table() respectively.

```{r}
gds3268_meta <- Meta(gds3268)
gds3268_meta
```

```{r}
gds3268_expression <- Table(gds3268)
gds3268_expression
```

**Save gse11223 & gds3268 objects in \_raw/**

underlying tables can be extracted from each when they're loaded as rds files, this ensures collectively of the two pulls when working with the data.

```{r}
write_rds(gds3268, file="../_raw/gds3268.rds")
write_rds(gse11223, file="../_raw/gse11223.rds")
```

\_raw/ will indeed only contain raw data pulls (apart from the disturbing list extraction for gse11223...).
